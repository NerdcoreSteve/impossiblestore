I can render views server side? Need to do that for first page load.
shouldn't have to commit build folder should I?
Should load react and the transformer with browserfy, webpack, require or somesuch
    tried requirejs, was slow to load
add underscore and bacon at least
or maybe just flow
what about immutable and their other libraries
